# Contribute to Logary

## Overview

 - Clone, add feature/fix, commit. Add test in Expecto style, in the right
   namespace, commit.
 - Send pull request and await review.

## License assignment

By contributing and sending a pull request you acknowledge that @haf has the
right to decide licensing for all code you're submitting. This licensing applies
to users of the Logary library.

The license you yield all code and rights to is Apache 2.0 but with a commercial
license required to run on MSFT-based web servers. This is because users and
contributors of open source software should be valued; contributing to
MSFT-based open source diminishes the capabilities of the whole F# community,
because MSFT only does "open source" in name only, and not by collaborating,
which is what "open source" is really about.
